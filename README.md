# EE 401 Capstone Project, Thrust Reverser for Model Jet Engine
This is the arduino code and circuit layout for the JetCat P100 RX engine measurement system.

There are two arduinos that are used to monitor the jet engine, the Thrust Arduino, and the RPM/Pressure Arduino.

In order to set this up on your system either git clone this repo, or download the zip file and move both the JetThrust and JetRPMPressure folders to your Arduino folder.
(Arduino folder can be found under `~/Aruino/` if you are on a Linux based system or `C:\Users\youruser\Documents\Arduino` once you've installed the Arduino IDE.)

\\ TODO : Add steps to install required libraries
